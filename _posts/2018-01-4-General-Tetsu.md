## General Tetsu
Campaign: Reborn

### Description
One of the highest ranking generals of the Southern Elven army. Tetsu has the ability to transform into a black dragon creature on will. When transformed, Tetsu grows wings and gains the ability of flight, as well as other common characteristics such as fire-breathing, powerful limbs and claws, a scaly hide, and just being overall quite large and menacing. Tetsu also gains the ability of antimagic. Rather than reflecting spells, Tetsu's presence is simply grating to any magic-users nearby. Attempting to cast a spell in General Tetsu's presence while he is in a draconic form will result in the magic-user feeling the "press of Tetsu's glowing eyes against the back of their head" as well as intense migraines. As such, most magic-users cannot concentrate for long enough to cast their spells, and any magic that does manage to hit Tetsu appears to be reduced by his dragon hide.

General Tetsu appears to have used this draconic form quite often in past battles, earning himself the nickname "The Dragon", and having several tactics and drills well-known by the army for securing the premises when he is transformed. It is implied that he can shift at will, however it appears to cause him distress in order to do so. Even when fatally injured, Tetsu is capable of making this transformation and shrugging off any injuries from his human form. It is unclear whether Tetsu is sentient or not in his draconic state, however he is known for causing collatoral damage while in this form.

### Drifters
After negotiations with the three elven factions went sour, the drifters attempted to kill General Tetsu (among others) to win passageway to the north and to appease at least a few of the elven groups. Despite being speared to the ground with his own sword, General Tetsu started his transformation into this state while mortally wounded and attacked the drifters on command from [x that old elf dude who was mean]. 

During the fight with General Tetsu, most of the magic-users in the group were disabled due to his antimagic effect, dealing psychic damage back at anyone attempting magic. The melee drifters did better at the start of the fight, but were rendered useless when General Tetsu took flight out of range and proceeded to set everyone on fire.

Some notable things that happened during the fight:
- Bojo consumed the essence of a demon, going berserk and killing two friendly drifters who were attempting to extinguish the fire on his clothing
- The Lantern Carrier, failing three consequtive attempts at casting magic, opting to smack the dragon's head with her staff out of frustration.
- At least one drifter throwing their weapon skyward in an attempt to hit General Tetsu while he flew
- An entire round where the drifters strategied how to put out as many people who were on fire as possible.
