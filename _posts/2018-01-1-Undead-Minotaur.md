## Undead Minotaur
Campaign: Illumina

### Description
Resembles a massive minotaur that has been corrupted by the god of the sea. Its flesh is rotten and peeled away like a zombie, and each is in a seperate state of decay. These creatures are ill-tempered and mindless, showing no form of higher-strategy when fighting besides beserk charges at their enemies, and wild swings of their massive axes. They dish out major damage with their crude weaponry, and their bodies are built to take and dish out lots of melee action. Unlike many undead, Undead Minotaurs appear to feel pain, although taking damage does not deter them from combat.

### Drifters
When conscripted to defend the city of Dalot, the drifters faced several Undead Minotaur that had been hurled from the attacking ships. These minotaur came flying in what appeared to be catapult amunition, burnind with purple fire, then began to assault the city once within the walls.

The first round of minotaur managed to strike down Andel and Tasma in surprise attacks, as well as nearly <a href="https://drifter-handbook.github.io/dibs7" >launching Reed off the side of the wall</a>, but all three minotaur were quickly disposed of by Dadude, Asriel, Reed, and Kled. Before the last minotaur died, however, it took hold of Kled's Demon Cleaver which had been cast aside. Once in possession of the cleaver, it transformed into an Undead Minotaur channelling what appeared to be the sea god's power. It restored itself, began sprouting tentacles and eyes, glowed with a purple energy, and acquired the ability to cast Darkness and Poison Cloud spells. As the fight progressed, it slowly became more engulfed in this exotic power, dropping to all fours and losing many of its minotaur characteristics in a chaotic blend of tentacles and eyes.
