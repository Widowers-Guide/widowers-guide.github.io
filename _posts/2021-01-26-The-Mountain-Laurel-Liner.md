##The Mountain Laurel Liner

LOCATION: ROCKY GAP STATE PARK, MARYLAND

MINERAL: RHODONITE

## Description

A bright pink insect that disguises itself as a grouping of flowers and leaves. Its head is disguised as a blooming flower, while its two pincers are disguised as two buds. The majority of the creature is melded into the plant itself, becoming not only indistinguishable in appearance, but fusing with the plant itself throughout its lifetime. While fused to a plant, it gives off a strong odor of sulfur and pine needles. The scent of the Mountain Laurel Liner is said to invoke childhood memories, the younger the memory provided for the older the person. Catching the scent of the Mountain Laurel Liner at the moment of sunrise on one's fifty-second birthday is rumored to provide a glimpse into an unknown future. Any plant fused with the Mountain Laurel Liner cannot be destroyed by natural means except at wintertime, when the Mountain Laurel Liner will go into hibernation and emerge to pick a new plant the following spring.

## Encounter
I'm a bit too young to try for the glimpse at a future, but I did enjoy the scent of the Mountain Laurel Liner during one of my stays at Rocky Gap. I was out on a stroll by the blue lake when I smelled the unpleasant odor of the faerie lurking nearby. I was distinctly reminded of a few years ago when I struck my head after falling off a bridge, and needing to go to the hospital for stitches soonafter. Not a pleasant memory to experience, though others say its generally a good memory they revisit when they find one of these faeries. I suppose I'm not particularily lucky.
