## Capital Vice Hotel
Campaign: Highway

### Description
A large, aristocratic hotel in the middle of nowhere sometime between the 1920s and the 1990s. While the base of the hotel is large, with a full bar, parlor, and helpdesk, the upper stories only have 2-3 rooms per floor. Something about the hotel's architechure and its contents appear to be twisted, with each floor of the building dedicated to one of the seven deadly sins.

The top floor has a single, regular hotel room.

The 6th Floor is Lust, with a single room where the singer downstairs has her room. When her door is opened, two copies of the singer appear with long, knife-like claws and attack.

The 5th Floor is Sloth, where a sleeping man in a wheelchair blocks the hallway. While progressing through the hallway, the floor and walls become sticky with a tar-like substance slowing movement.

The 4th Floor is Pride, where a gigantic demon demands an unknown sacrifice before allowing people to pass. The demon will kill any who refuse to pay the price or who attack. If all those present agree to the unknown demands, the demon bows and allows them to pass, having given up their pride.

The 3rd Floor is Greed, with a single door which shows a room containing the place or object that the person most wants to see. Stepping into the door causes that person to vanish.

The 2rd Floor is Gluttony, with a room full of a family of cannibals, where meat hangs from steel hooks suspended from the cieling. They attempt to force others to eat flesh as well, and fight if any refuse.

The 1st Floor is the lobby, with a small performance parlor where the Lust singer performs.

### Drifters 
The drifters were driven to the Captial Vice Hotel by Mr.Smith. Upon arriving, they milled about in the parlor for a bit of time, getting drinks and competing against the Lust singer in her singing routine. When night fell, they were given keys to go to the 7th floor to sleep.

The 7th floor was filled with blood and surgical equipment upon arriving, and a corpse of a young lady was found in the bathtub. A small baby was found in the corner of the room, which the drifters were tasked with protecting.

Attempting to take the elevator on the 7th floor revealed that the elevator shaft was empty, with a hand-tendril demon lurking within it and lashing out at them. When the demon was dealt with, the drifters were forced to take the stairs to go down every floor and face each floor's demon.

Goro the Boarman was killed on the 6th floor, attempting to stall Lust while allowing the others to escape. 

Nex was killed on the 4th floor, shown a vision of her lost dog and following it into the room.

One of the drifters became a cannibal on the 2nd floor after being pulled in by the demons of gluttony.

Upon returning to the 1st floor's lobby, the entire hotel was empty save for Lucielle Johnson, who thanked the drifters and attempted to take the baby. John Smith, however, refused to hand over the child after hearing about the things Lucielle Johnson had done, and instead took it down to the church down the road, with no protest from Lucielle Johnson.
