## Dalot
Campaign: Illumina

### Description

Dalot is a large, centralized city that is largely nocturnal. It is a city of tourism and commerce, but also has a well established miltary presence and educational system. Dalot is formed around large white wooden walls that appear to be carved from the ground.

### Drifters 

The Drifters were originally headed towards the city of Dalot when they first set sail at the start of the Illumina saga. After having their fleet destroyed and eventually rejoining the mainland, the Drifters decided the best course of action would be to head to set course for Dalot.
