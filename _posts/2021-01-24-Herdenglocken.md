## Herdenglocken

LOCATION: BUTTERMILK FALLS STATE PARK, NEW YORK

MINERAL: CARNELIAN

## Description

A small black cow with angelic antlers. Many, many cowbells composed of light are tied around its neck, body, and horns. The true form of the Herdenglocken is only visible if you manage to catch its eye. Upon direct eye contact, this form is visible, otherwise it appears to be a regular white-tailed deer. The Herdenglocken's bells make a soft jumble of sound as it picks its way from place to place at the falls, and the sound instills a deep sense of peace in those who hear it. Staying in its presence too long will cause humans to become quite lathargic and content with simply following the creature deep into the heart of the nearby marshes. Herdenglocken, in defiance, bellows and chases away any humans who become too entranced by its presence.

## Encounter
One of the most pleasent encounters I've had, though also one of the longest. I stayed in New York as my primary home for nearly thirty years, never once taking sight of the creature. Buttermilk Falls was one of my favorite destinations, not too far away from where I lived (or at least, not far enough that I considered it trouble. Others may say otherwise...). I always was amused by the park's name, and applauded whoever had made the comparison of the waterfalls' frothy coats to milk. I did not realize until I met Herdenglocken, though, that the name stemmed from another source. I counted myself lucky that day to spot a deer along the path, and followed it for a bit at distance. As it gazed back at me, however, it transformed before my eyes into Herdenglocken, and I was utterly captivated by the creature's beauty. How long I followed it along, I know not, but by the time it bellowed and charged me, breaking my trance, the sun had set and I was alone under a starlit sky with a song in my heart. I'll never know such peace as that listening to the Herdenglocken's soft bells, like an ode to a distant pasture.
