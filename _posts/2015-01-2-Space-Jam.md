## Space Jam
Campaign: Illumina

### Personality
Space Jam is a notably curious person, opting to throw herself into strange and odd journeys on the whim that it will interest her. She appears to keep a fair deal of caution when investigating dangerous situations, but she also has a tendency to act without thinking things through. While Space Jam is excited to be a part of the driters, she appears to be apprehensive about several members and their odd behaviours, such as Reed's dissapearing acts and Tasma's death and possession.

### Description
A 4' black-furred tabaxi wearing a stylized chainmail jersey. Space Jam is a death cleric, very powerful at reviving fallen allies by channeling the energy of the undead.

### Story
Space Jam is familiar to the area where she first met the drifters, and was found wandering the wilds. Not much is known about her past or how she became a death cleric, but she appears to have been living in the area for a bit before meeting the drifters. Space Jam has admitted to having lost a fair deal of money gambling on card games developed on the continent.

### Drifters
Space Jam was the last entry to the Illumina drifters, having followed Reed on one of his strolls through the woods and following him back to the group after introducing herself. After having a scale implanted in her hand by Sun, Space Jam was officially recognized as a drifter, and inducted into their journeys. 

During their first fights, Space Jam became well-known for her ability to <a href="https://drifter-handbook.github.io/inquiry9" >4'revive fallen enemies</a>... but most effectively only when they are dealt lethal blows. As such, upon taking heavy damage Tasma decided to bury a sword in her gut while she was standing next to Space Jam, hoping to be healed completely soonafter. After saying "See you in a bit!", Tasma died and was corrupted by the sea god, attackind Space Jam and causing great confusion to the feline.
