## The Beaver Stickbearer

LOCATION: WOOD TIKCHIK STATE PARK, ALASKA

MINERAL: SODALITE

## Description

A broad-nosed beaver which swims from shore to shore, carrying its three-pronged stick above the water. It has a more human-shaped face than a regular beaver, with soft rubbery scales running along its nose, and a thin cat-like tail. Two small twigs hover around its face. Highly concerned with the maintaining of fish in the area. It grunts as it swims from place to place, and never dives down into the water. The fish populations of the areas it visits stabilize.

## Encounter

Only caught a glimpse as I was passing by in the morning. It was muttering to itself as it prepared to launch its body into the freezing water. Its fur was slick with water from past journeys made, and it did not regard me. It was my first time meeting a stick bearer, but not a very memorable one, seeing as it did not deign to speak with me. I was surprised to pick out a few words though as it mumbled to itself, though they are too obtuse and rude to repeat.
