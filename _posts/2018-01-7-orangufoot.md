## Orangufoot
Campaign: Brass Tree

### Description
Wandering around the woods of Washoregon lives a looming, bigfoot-like creature. While not particularily hostile, this creature appears to have been the experiment of a visiting alien in the area, and serves the alien's own violent purposes. The Orangufoot is a stitched-together beast controlled by the alien atop the observatory in Washoregon, having been reassembled by the lifeforce as it attempted to understand the creatures of earth. As such, the Orangufoot appears as a cobbled together mess of several creatures, but remains primarily primate in nature. Its bulk makes it near impossible to kill, becoming a bullet-sponge with its already torn apart form. It possesses great strength in its limbs, capable of trouncing about the forest to maim anything nearby and drag it back to the observatory for experimentation.

### Drifters
After being called together for a funeral in Washoregon, the drifters were pursued by the Orangufoot as they journeyed through the hills at night. The Orangufoot managed to capture a few of the drifters and drag them back (breaking the spine of one), leading to a final confrontation with the alien atop the observatory and, by extention, Lucielle Johnson. 

The Orangufoot was later killed pursuing the gorilla god's disciple, who had taken up shelter in a nearby ranger station. Retreating back to town, the drifter returned with company to find that the body of the creature had vanished. The legend of the Orangufoot lived on for a few years, but all eyewitnesses were later thought mad, and it faded out into folklore for the city.
