## Nefarious Wheel
Campaign: Age of Heroes

### Description
A machine twisted by dark magic to kill the drifters. Originally a ferris wheel in the heart of the amusement park, the Nefarious Wheel was corrupted by Lucielle Johnson into a blistering metal wheel that seeks destruction. The device appears to be a mutated version of its machine-self, possessing hints of monsterous flesh but mainly accruing debris and contorted metal on its rampage. It spins at a dangerous speed, plowing through the amusement park and crushing anything beneath it. In the whirlwind of chaos, it was not completely clear what sort of beast lies beneath the metal, but some claim they see spurts of fire from the detatched engines of the Nefarious Wheel. It stands at twelve stories tall, and leaves ruts in its path.

### Drifters
The final challenge of Lucielle Johnson's amusement park was the ferris wheel. The drifters, having only a few minutes before their compatriat exploded, were chased down by the ferris wheel as it came alive. During the chase, several of the remaining drifters were brutally crushed under it, or killed by debris and zombies that came along with.

Atop one of the carriages, however, was the last banana needed by the gorilla god's servant to appease his deity. While he died shortly after, he was able to successfully retrieve the banana and complete his life mission.

The Nefarious Wheel was eventually thwarted by evading it and steering it into obstacles around the fairgrounds. The wheel eventually lost momentum, caught up in its own trail of destruction, and fell apart. Despite Lucielle Johnson's best efforts to kill Nero, the man survived with two minutes left on the bomb in the middle of his chest, and he survived yet another session.
