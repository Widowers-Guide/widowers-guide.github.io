## Washoregon
Campaign: Drachend

### Geography
A small, cozy state on the the west coast of the United States, sometime in the 1930s-1970s. The land itself is sprawling, full of pine trees, hills and well-known for its gorgeous autumn colorings. The cities in Washoregon are newly established, small suburbs that have broken off from the hubub of the city life. Most of the state remains shattered in terms of geography, with long stretches of road inbetween most of the small towns. Due to the land, a great deal of the cities in Washoregon are not only hard to reach, but also remain fairly isolated from the others, developing their own cultures and myths. The dense woods engulfing most of the state cover up its secrets.

### Notable Locations
Small City Bar - The reception of the funeral was held in a small restaurant in the bar, where most of the drifters ordered hot chocolates and coffee to stave off the cold from the rain outside. Warm and hospitable, with good food and good rates. One of the few taverns we've visited that hasn't been awful.

Cemetary - An old but still well-maintained cemetary just outside the city limits, on the part of Mt.Hood Village on the border with the large mountains to the north.

Mount Hood - A small cresting mountain, rounded into a sort of hill. Dense forest lines the entirety of the mountain, making travel on foot difficult, but travel via car just as bad. A large observatory used by the Baxter family stands at its peak. Supposedly a large asteriod landed on the mountain nearly 200 years ago. 3 years ago, rumors of alien activity started in the area, and a few fires were seen burning in the woods.

Ranger's Outpost - A small two-story building a bit east of Mount Hood, about halfway up its side. Empty, but stocked with ammunition and supplies. Briefly made famous when the Orangufoot was claimed to have been killed in the building. The floorboards are still stained with blood, but no evidence of the beast was ever found.

The Baxter Observatory - A small observatory built at the top of Mount Hood for Prof.Baxter, an avid astronomer who died a few weeks before the drifters arrived. The observatory was taken over by an alien lifeforce, both curious about life on the planet and malicious towards it. The alien, still trapped in its cage, slowly built its base around the observatory, manipulating people's minds to have them do its bidding from the outside, and creating composite creatures such as the Orangufoot to aid it in collecting volunteers. 

Pelly Trace was shot in the head, but reanimated and made into the alien's obedient servant. Both Elli Bang and Reed Allen were confronted by Lucielle Johnson during the final encounter as well. Reed Allen attempted to escape the Observatory, but walked back into the building from the porch after being spooked by Lucielle Johnson. Elli Bang refused the alien's offer and was told "I gave you a choice. You didn't take it. Maybe next time." by Lucielle Johnson before being killed. (These endings reinforced the trend of Noah's characters always being forced into obedience by Lucielle Johnson, and Savvy's characters always defying Lucielle Johnson)

### Drifters 
The drifters were called together to hear the will of Professor Baxter after his untimely death. Unfortunately, as it would turn out the entire funeral was a ruse to bring these strange people together, a fact that they discovered immediately upon entering the small city bar and asking each other how they knew the deceased. Already on-edge, the drifters spent most of their time trying to dig up clues surrounding a "Brass Tree".

After defiling a grave, scouting out the area , and taming a squirrel, the drifters made their way up the mountain where they split into groups, being chased by the Orangufoot. Those that made it to the top of the observatory found a homicidal alien with the ability to mentally paralyze and reanimate human beings without ever leaving its abode. The alien claimed to have brought them all together to use their respective skills. After a brief standoff where none of the drifters were able to fight back, all the drifters at the observatory were tortured and killed.

The few drifters that had not gone to the observatory either followed through on killing the Orangufoot, or fled the city altogether. A few months later, a funeral was held for the drifters killed atop the observatory. This funeral was attended by both Sunny and Mr.Smith, who both expressed regrets for the fallen drifters.
