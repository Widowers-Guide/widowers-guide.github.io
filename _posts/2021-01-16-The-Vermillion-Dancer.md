## The Vermillion Dancer

LOCATION: LAKE VERMILLION STATE PARK, SOUTH DAKOTA

MINERAL: CINNABAR

## Description

A bright red peahen with a feather crest that runs all the way down its spin and back. Its body is a solid, hard red, with no color variants throughout. When standing still, it can be easily mistaken for a work of art, something made of clay and painted red or perhaps sculpted. From a distance it appears to be made of rock or stone, but closer inspection reveals the fluffy feathers of its down are still present, just obscured by the sheer absolution of the coloring of the bird. It made soft peeping noises when disturbed, and dances for anyone who approaches it with goodwill. When the Vermillion Dancer dances, it strikes the ground with its red talons and creates stunning blue sparks, which it uses to heighten the excitement of the affair.

## Encounter

The Vermillion Dancer is easy to find, but harder to convince to dance. While she is quite kind and charitable to those who live in the area, she's not particularily fond of strangers. Whether this is malice or simpy stagefright, I'm not certain, but three of my companions had found her in the past, and none had been given the chance to view the dance. I was sure my night would go the same way, but after talking with the Vermillion Dancer, she was willing to show me once. The dance was beautiful, a long series of twists and twirls with sparks flying about into the night. At the end of the dance, she dissapeared into the night, with the blue sparks settling up into the stars.
