## Purple-Ringed Clams

LOCATION: AGATE BEACH STATE PARK, OREGON

MINERAL: AGATE

## Description

A type of razor clam only found at Agate Beach, only defined on appearance by its distinctive purple stripe running along the top of its shell. Purple-Ringed Clams are not uncommon, but are rarely identified, and highly-localized to a strip of shoreline about ten paces into the water (low-tide). Purple-Ringed Clams are best known for their ability to chirp, as well as their ability to grant wishes. The strength of the wish is determined by the intensity of the purple coloring, and their wish-granting abilities appear to be quite limited regardless. Nonetheless, Purple-Ringed Clams are an exciting creature to find and dig up, as well as prepare and enjoy.

## Encounter
I'm usually not fond of thinking about the potential edibility of my researchees, and typically less so when it comes to anything that lives in the water and is vaguely fish-escque. Nonetheless, I was reassured by a couple of school-aged kids along the beach that the activity of Purple-Circle Clam digging was not only a fun endeavor, but also a rewarding one for the meal at the end of the day. I spent a bit of the afternoon with the two as they pulled me into the water and guided me around to their favorite hunting grounds. After learning the tells and equipping myself with a good shovel, I was able to fish out a bucket full of them (as well as a few regular razor clams). I saved my biggest wishes for the two with the most distinctive purple stripes, but neither of my wishes came true. It was a wonderful evening regardless, and I was invited to a bbq dinner with the family afterwards.
