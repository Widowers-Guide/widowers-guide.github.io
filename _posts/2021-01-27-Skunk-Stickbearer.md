## The Skunk Stickbearer

LOCATION: WOLFE'S NECK WOODS STATE PARK, MAINE

MINERAL: AQUAMARINE

## Description

A very small striped skunk who roams the coast of Maine upon a small raft. She is unusually small in stature, barely more than two inches tall, and stands on her hind legs while walking about on her raft. She carries a three-pronged stick which she uses as a paddle to move her raft about. She is in constant conflict with the red tide, and travels constantly to combat the algea blooms which pop up along the coastline. She waves her stick about like a wand, purifying water or changing its composition with a few touches against the ocean's surface. Despite her travels and her immense power, the Skunk Stickbearer is terrified of water.

## Encounter

Largely unnoticed, the Skunk Stickbearer was more than happy to spend some time chatting with me when I found her over on Crescent Beach. She was in pursuit of a large red tide taking root over at Old Orchard Beach, but seemed happy to talk with me about her life and profession. Despite her small stature, she claimed she could cover nearly two hundred miles of coast a day with minimal effort. Born from the ocean itself, she lived a quaint life on land for many years, serving as a Stickbearer a little further North in Canada, but she ran into trouble as a teenager and was banished from the land. As such, she now roams the coast of Maine, continuing to fulfill her duties on her little raft, and trying desperately not to fall into the ocean which she fears. While she was not inclined to share the rest of her predicament, she implied that she was, at one point, human, and that her hatred of the red tide has much to deal with her banishment. I was allowed to pick her mind for only about ten minutes or so before she insisted she be on her way, but not before wishing me a fine day before speeding off into the distance.
