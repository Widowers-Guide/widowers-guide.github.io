##Fossil Snatcher

LOCATION: FALLS OF OHIO STATE PARK, INDIANA

MINERAL: RUBY

## Description

A large mess of conglomarate stones, all held together by a shadowy force. Small fossils are visible along the long faces of the rocks, of all shapes and sizes and time periods. Some fossils don't appear to be of any real creature, but perhaps a fabricated extinct being. Ledge-like appendages jut out of its body and move it fowards in a scuttle, like a beetle. Its eyes are light blue and shine from the center of the rock mass. Its rock hide changes daily. It can animate the fossils on its body, bringing them to life while they are attached to its body. The re-animated creatures rest on the body of the stone creature, moving slightly before settling down into their original positions when deactivated.

## Encounter
A startling encounter, to say the least. Fossil Snatcher got its name from its habit of laying on the ground in wait, and then roaming the banks of the river at night, picking up any loose fossils it finds and favors. I left out a particularily nice trilobite fossil I found the day prior to arriving, and the Fossil Snatcher appeared while I was hiding nearby. It took one look at the fossil and scuttled off, rejecting the piece for its cloak. It must be highly particular...
