## Young Stag

LOCATION: UNION GROVE STATE PARK, SOUTH DAKOTA

MINERAL: Corundrum

## Description

A young male deer with velvet still on his small horns. A necklace of hawthorne berries hang around his neck. His fur appears windswept and his posture is always defiant. So long as the necklace of hawthorne berries hangs around its throat, Young Stag cannot be hurt or killed. He does not appear to age, and spends his days rushing from place to place like an errant youth. He butts into other people's business quite often, and can be quite stubborn, but he has a good heart. Despises birds, as they tend to try to swipe some of the berries for a midday meal.

## Encounter

I stumbled upon Young Stag as he was getting a drink of water from a puddle along the horse trails. He seemed interested in me, but did not seem vocal. His presence had a stunning effect on me, though, reminding me of what it was like when I was a child roaming about the woods. Young Deer embodies a lot of that wanderlust, that feeling of conquering nature, despite the fact that he lives within it. I asked around to many sources to try to figure out how Young Deer had gotten his necklace of berries. Some claimed that the necklace was given to him by a group of three elderly crows, but that they had a falling out and now the crows send their friends to try to retrieve their gift back. Others simply say that Young Buck wove the necklace himself, and the birds are upset that he does not share the secret of immortality with the world.
