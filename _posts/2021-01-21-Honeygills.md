## Honeygills

LOCATION: HONEY CREEK STATE PARK, OKLAHOMA

MINERAL: AMETHYST

## Description

A stunning amber fish similar to your typical Bluegill, but with beautiful yellow-orange scales and unique black markings along its face and side. Honeygills travel in packs of three: one male, one female, and one which is neither. These three fish are born together and die together, never parting from each others side. At some point late in their lives, the fish split apart into phantom images of each other, creating three clones of themselves, and the three clones become their own grouping of Honeygills. If a Honeygill is ever seperated from its pack, or if the pack is ever split, it reverts to being a common Bluegill, and sheds a golden scale.

## Encounter
These are quite fun fish to watch on any given day, but seeking them out in the heart of summertime is the best time to try to find these fish. I once spent an entire evening trying to catch a set of Honeygills, wondering if there was anything more to them than the legends suggested. I set up three fishing rods, each armed with the same bait and casted in fairly similar distances. After catching many bluegills and other small fish, I got a streak of luck and caught three fish simultaneously! When I managed to reel them in though, I was surprised to find that it was naught but a three-headed turtle. I ended up spending the next day just idling by the lake, and sure enough the honeygills came out in droves, content to simply swim past me or nibble upon my toes.
