## Carnelian Kirin

LOCATION: PURGATORY CHASM STATE PARK, MASSACHUSETTS

MINERAL: CARNELIAN

## Description

A slender, chestnut breed of Kirin which occupy a sliver of the Massachusetts area. As is necessary to point out in every Kirin entry: Kirin are not aggressive, but should not be approached! The Carnelian Kirin is a fairly stereotypical kirin, but features a bony protrusion on the back of both of its hind legs, as well as bony plates running along its back and ribs. The Carnelian Kirin's power waxes with the sun's setting, and wanes with the sun's rise. Carnelian Kirin share in their kind's immortality and fondness for riddles, and the answer to a Carnelian's riddle will always be something undervalued and despised. Carnelian Kirin's caches often contain enchanted carnelian gems, unidentifiable but delicious cured meats, and sprigs of saffron.

## Encounter

Kirin are not to be trifled with, especially if you are not prepared for their riddles! Thankfully, my mentor taught me the tricks to dealing with local kirin long ago, so I was able to safetly pursue and negotiate with a stray Carnelian over at Purgatory Chasm, near the Fat Man's Misery rock. Though I had a strong clue for the Kirin's riddle, it still took me quite a bit of time to solve, and all the while the kirin paced and prodded along my path. When I did finally figure out the riddle, the answer vanished off my lips and from my mind and heart and the kirin led me to its stash of goods. I ended up taking a few of the enchanted gems (which I later traded off to Voyager in exchange for some fast travel across the states), as well as a handful of saffron and one roll of what I believed was summer sausage. The Carnelian Kirin seemed pleased I did not take any additional pieces from its cache. The saffron was a delight to cook with in the coming camping trips, though I admit I ditched the meat, rather than ate it.
