## Baumen's Beholder
Campaign: Ashen

### Description
A multi-eyed fleshy orb, rotten but springing with new life. The tendrils of eyes spiraling out from its center have been imbued with the power of Baumen, almost appearing like flowers in appearance. The rest of its body, however, is decayed and disgusting. The creature is missing the bottom half of its jaw, with black rot overtaking its gums and the lids of its eyes. It appears to be sightless, but in reality its vision is as keen as ever, able to both spot enemies and channel dangerous amounts of energy through its core eye. It has the ability to disintegrate living creatures, ravaging them with intense necrotic energy. 


### Drifters
During their first encounter with Baumen, the god speared Kingsley Oldbeard through with a tree root and left him to die. He then summoned a zombie beholder and an undead army in an attempt to finish off the drifters. Several of the drifters had to evade the beholder while trying to get across the island to where Kingsley lay dying to save him. Through a nat20 medicine save, a healing potion, and a high-level healing spell from Skozz, Kingsley Oldbeard lived through the encounter. The beholder remained distracted by the fighters for a few rounds, until Bojo's magical music caused the Beholder to turn away and instead attack those trying to save Kingsley. 

In a miraculous dodge while unconscious, Kingsley managed to avoid the attack and survive the attack. The Lantern Carrier, however, was partially disintegrated and almost killed instantly. It was Sariel, shifted into a lion's form, who managed to take down the Beholder by tackling it into the boiling river around the island. Baumen's Beholder began to boil in the water, and the combo of Bojo and Schmee managed to finish off the monster with a stab to the central eye.
