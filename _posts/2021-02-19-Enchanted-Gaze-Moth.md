## Enchanted Gaze Moth

LOCATION: BIG BEND RANCH STATE PARK, TEXAS

MINERAL: AGATE

## Description

A set of gigantic, luminescent sphinx moths that roam Texas, lighting down in Big Bend Ranch as their home during the winter. Enchanted Gaze mothes are nearly a foot in length, but weigh little more than a gram. These moths appear to have a strong connection with the stars, and often times rearrange the luminous patterns along their backs to mimic the passage of stars across the winter sky. While they are incapable of speech, they seem to understand it, and will obey human command if trained.


## Encounter
I've never been down to Texas myself, but I knew a woman once who owned an Enchanted Gaze Moth. She was kind enough to show me it when I was interviewing her for another journal, and it was a delightful fellow. One might be offput a bit by the gigantic size of the moth, but it's quickly remedied by the sheer amount of fuzz and cuddliness of the creature. The Enchanted Gaze Moth demonstrated abotu the same intelligence level as, say, a dog: able to easily learn and repeat tricks, as well as showing some personality of its own. While I did not get a chance to view it at night, when these creatures truly show their beauty, I was throughly impressed by the comraderie between human and moth shown that day. (To train an Enchanted Gaze Moth, I'm told that fish are the primary treat they ought to be given)
