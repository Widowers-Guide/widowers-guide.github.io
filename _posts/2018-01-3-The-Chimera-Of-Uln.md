## The Chimera of Uln
Campaign: Ashen

### Description
A hulking, terrifying creature which took up residence outside the city of Uln, killing anyone passing through the forest outside Uln's walls. It appeared shortly after the fall of the Southern continent, and destroyed nearly a third of the city in its initial attack. The creature is enormous, standing nearly two stories tall, and has three primary heads (one of a lion, one of a goat, and one of a dragon). The lion head spews fire over a great radius, and the beast's heads are fatal to anyone within biting range. It does not appear to be sentient, but is very intelligent, going to great lengths to hunt down those who have fled the city's walls, and refusing to be sated by anything other than human flesh. The beast was kept at bay by offering 10 human limbs (which were given as part of a lottery system), to quell the beast's hunger. It refuses to eat drugged meat or the meat of any other animal. The internals of the Chimera resemble that of the undead, filled with rotten flesh and sludge.

### Drifters
The drifters arrived in Uln to find the Chimera lurking outside, blocking all pathways through the city. Those in the city had been beseiged by the Chimera for several weeks, and nearly every survivor of the Chimera's initial attack had lost limbs to the beast in their lottery system. 

Andrew's Tiefling's hand and the Lantern Carrier's foot were cut off to feed to the beast. Neither drew a red stick in the lottery, but were selected through other means.

The drifter's initial plan was to drug the meat given to the Chimera, but they were later talked out of the plan in favor of seeking out a cannon to kill the beast. 

During the fight with the beast, the cannon took too long to set up and instead the creature was killed using an array of magic and ranged attacks. The Chimera's breath slaughtered nearly half of the drifters on its initial attack, save for those who were still on the tower and the drifter riding the Chimera's back.

The loot collected from the Chimera was:
- Bojo's Gutted Ram Mask (Bojo)
- The Chimera's Ram Horn (Lantern Carrier)
- Several vials of the rot within the Chimera (Baba Yaga)
- The Chimera's Lion Head (Admiral Ye)
