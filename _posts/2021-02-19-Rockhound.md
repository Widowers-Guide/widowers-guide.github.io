## Barrel

LOCATION: ROCKHOUND STATE PARK, NEW MEXICO

MINERAL: PYRITE

## Description

A strange, brown wolf-like creature with a stone head and hide. It has a long, thick scruff of fur that is poorly maintained, and the rest of the fur on its body appears frazzled and torn. The stone that makes up its head is grey and smooth, cut into a triangular pattern with eyeholes and small protrusions resembling teeth. It has various other smooth stones covering or making up its body. Barrel has some sort of affiliation with flowers, and causes nearby plants to glow and warm up when he's nearby. It's unclear what exactly this does to the environment though, as well as what sort of abilities Barrel possesses.


## Encounter
The name "Barrel" ended up being in reference to how I found the poor fellow. I'd heard rumor of the beast roaming Rockhound State Park, but none had ever given me a name, only the idea that something kept showing up and "causing the fields to glow" or "setting them aflame". I first set out looking for scorch marks, before realizing that perhaps there was no fire and instead folks were just seeing odd lights at night. After about three months of staking out the area, I found the creature stuck in an old discarded pickle barrel that someone had thrown down a gorge many, many years ago. His head was jammed right in there, inflexible since it was a rock. And he required a bit of assistance getting free of the contraption...
