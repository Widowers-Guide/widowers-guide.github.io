## Shad-Shadow

LOCATION: ELMORE STATE PARK, UTAH

MINERAL: MORGANITE

## Description

An armored faerie with a squirrel-like body, thin and spry. It wears a mask with a plated collar running down its neck, obscuring its face. Unlike a squirrel, the lower half of its body is much thicker and sturdier than you'd expect, and its tail is almost ribbon-like, uniform in width throughout and not fluffy. It carries an odd instrument: a branch with a split end on one side, sprouting leaves, and a few acorns tied onto the opposite end. It fights using its shadow to trip and trick opponents, much larger than itself, and is adamant about keeping the park in pristine condition.


## Encounter
Shad-shadow was the first creature I encountered whom I needed to book an appointment to see. While she has no entourage or lackeys, like other busy creatures, she does require you to write to her in advance before visiting. I took the necessary precautions before visiting Shad-Shadow: preparing a letter, donating a few blueberries, and sealing the envelope at the peak of dusk. I recieved a letter back nearly a year later inviting me up to Vermont, and I ended up meeting her atop the fire tower over in Elmore State Park. Shad-shadow was kind enough to answer my questions regarding her role at the park, which mainly boiled down to keeping predatory creatures away from humans and keeping human trash out of vulnerable spots in the woods. When pressed about her fighting prowess, Shad-shadow refused to answer how exactly she used her tool to fend off threats, but did claim that she'd once fought off two black bears at once, and was an expert in eradicating tick poplations.
