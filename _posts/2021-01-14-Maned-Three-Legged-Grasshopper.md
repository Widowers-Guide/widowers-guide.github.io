## Maned Three-Legged Grasshopper

LOCATION: BANNACK STATE PARK, MONTANA

MINERAL: JADE

## Description

A pale white grasshopped with square-shaped markings, and a distinct lack of limbs. It has both of its arms, but only one of its legs, which props it up as it goes sailing along from the path to the grass and the rocks. It has a startlingly bright tuft of white hair on its head, and an incredibly long and fluffy tail the consistency of corn silk. It merry jumps from place to place, making no noise save for the soft click of its feet against the ground. It brings fleeting luck to all who catch it, followed by a gratuitous helping of fortune and popularity, which fades away within a few years.

## Encounter

Quite the merry little creature to find, and easy to spot at a distance. I've only seen one Maned Three-Legged Grasshopper, and I'm inclined to think it is the only of its sort, given how friendly it was and how long I stayed at Bannack State Park. The Maned Three-Legged Grasshopper came to me around noon as I was at the base of a hill, and it flitted about me for quite some time, as though taunting me, tempting me to catch it. I opted against it, knowing a bit of the creatures history prior to my first arrival at the park, and instead was content to observe it and be on my way. Quite the handsome fellow.
