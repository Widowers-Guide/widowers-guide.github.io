## The Chadron Osprey

LOCATION: CHADRON STATE PARK, NEBRASKA

MINERAL: LAPIS LAZULI

## Description

An osprey with several bones jutting out of its neck where the pin feathers form, and a collection of sharp fish bones which hover in front of its plumed chest. Its feathers shine like fish scales, and it keeps its head tilted up towards the sun, rather than down at the surface of the water. The Chadron Osprey hangs around the lagoon, harassing many of the fishermen and animals hoping to spend an evening snagging fish from below the surface of the water. Once a fish has been caught, the Chadron Osprey makes a startling call, then swoops down and plucks the fish off the line or out of the mouth of a predator, plopping the prey back into the water and cackling at the catcher as it retreats back to its perch.

## Encounter

I must admit, the hardest part was trying to catch a fish for this one. Several of the local fishers were eager to share their stories of stolen catches, but I wanted to try to see the creature first hand. I staked out my spot, the best spot as I was assured by many others, and plopped myself down in the afternoon shade to catch a fish. Despite several bites, I didn't catch anything, and fell asleep at my pole. In the morning, I found the Chadron Osprey perched at the top of my fishing pole, staring me down as I woke up. It flapped over to my face, and with a sound peck, made its way back to its favored tree at the lagoon, waiting for me to catch something. I stayed for a bit longer, but eventually lost my nerve and decided to let the bird be.
