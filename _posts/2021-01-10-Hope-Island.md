## The Hope Chime

LOCATION: HOPE ISLAND STATE PARK, WASHINGTON

MINERAL: JAMESONITE

## Description

A floating cage of metal with four wings, best described as a floating wing-chime. All of the wires holding it together are thin and sparkling, and its wings do not flap as it moves. The top and bottom of the cage are bookended with dark wooden circles, polished and stained like good furniture. In the center of the cage, another dark circle of wood is suspended, with two holes drilled though it on the top and bottom. Trinkets, baubles, and chimes dangled from every inch of its body. The bottom of its body tapers off into a twisting, disjointed tornado of metal slivers which do not move. It seems content to float from place to place, and hang itself from the branches of various trees. It makes no noise until spotted, at which point it becomes very loud.

## Encounter

A tricky one to spot, and not a fun one to catch unawares. I was able to catch up to the Hope Chime three times on my visit to the island, each one as jarring as the last. It hangs from the top of the trees, waiting for someone to find it. Despite blowing in the wind, it makes noise, and I only spotted it based off the sun glinting off its body. I can't imagine trying to spot it on a cloudy day. When spotted, it makes a great cacophony of sound, panicking those around it, and flits away to another tree. I've named it the Hope Chime based on the island, not any amount of hope it brings me... I also swear it changes shape. I wrote it down to be nearly 10ft in length the first time I spotted it, and less than a foot the second time. I can't seem to recall which is correct though, which is concerning.
