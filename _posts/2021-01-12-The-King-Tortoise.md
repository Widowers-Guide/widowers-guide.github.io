## The King Tortoise

LOCATION: ROUND LAKE STATE PARK, IDAHO

MINERAL: GOLD

## Description

A gigantic beetle, about the size of a bowling bowl, constantly surrounded by its younger variants. It resembles a Golden Tortoise Beetle in most ways, save for a few rather jarring differences. For starters, it has retained the wispy, black tendrils of its larval form, now hardened into spike-like appendages. Second, a small orb hovers over its face. Third, it's gigantic. The other insects of the area appear to serve the King Tortoise, and it accepts offerings from them all. When it sings, the entire forest falls asleep. The lullaby of the Golden Tortoise ensures sweet dreams.

## Encounter

An easier find. I wasn't able to find a Golden Tortoise Beetle easily, but I found enough insects carrying odd materials in the same direction to start to put together a trail. The closer I got, the more beetles I spotted, along with other creatures, some even winged. While the King Tortoise may seem small on a grander scale of things, it's quite intimidating to see up close. I got a bit panicked as I approached, and ended up placing my offering and leaving shortly thereafter. One of the king's stewards was my informant on the lullaby part of the King Tortoise's repitoire. I didn't catch his name, nor do I think I'd be able to spot the same beetle twice in the woods on look alone.
