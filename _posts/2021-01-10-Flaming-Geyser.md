## The Flaming Geyser Wyrm

LOCATION: FLAMING GEYSER STATE PARK, WASHINGTON

MINERAL: CARNELIAN

## Description

A hybrid creature. Its head appears draconic, with an armadillo-like plating leading across its torso. The lower half of its body is missing its hind legs, instead tapering off into a strange array of gushing water, filed to a point near the end of the tail. The horns on its head are flat and tapered, like ears made of cartilage. It pops out of the water, being carried around on the rapids, and lunges onto land using its powerful front legs. Spurts of fire come out of its nostrils when it lunges.

## Encounter

Even though I spotted it at a distance, the wyrm still started me with the abruptness of its movements. It appeared at sunset, popping out of water of the rapids as the river turned a muddy orange. Snapped at something in the underbrush as it leapt out of the water, then departed. Bullish in behaviour but too small to be anything more than a nuisance. A few locals say that it comes by at sunset when the flame geyser is still lit, but that it never lingers long.
