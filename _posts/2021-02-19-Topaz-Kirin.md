## Topaz Kirin

LOCATION: LONGHORN CAVERN STATE PARK, TEXAS

MINERAL: TOPAZ

## Description

A bulky, tawny-hide breed of Kirin which occupy the caves of the Longhorn Cavern State Park. As is necessary to point out in every Kirin entry: Kirin are not aggressive, but should not be approached! The Topaz Kirin is an oddly strong kirin, built more like an ox or a cow than a deer, with thick curling horns. The Topaz Kirin's power is drawn from darkness, so it will seldom leave the caves in which it lives unless it is dark out. Topaz Kirin do not share in their kind's immortality, but do have a fondness for riddles, and the answer to a Topaz's riddle will always be something that could be found on a different planet. Topaz Kirin's caches often contain enchanted topaz gems, moss, and dried bones.


## Encounter
This entry has been added based on reports found in an old, waterlogged book I found out in New Mexico that had no title, no author, and fell apart shortly after acquiring it. Alas, I have never been to Texas, myself, so I cannot confirm nor deny the Kirin's existence. It seems to fit the schema for most of kirin I have found though, so I would expect there to be a great deal of truth here. I've copied over the blurry sketch of the Kirin into this book as well, though the original depiction belongs to whomever wrote that odd book I found.
