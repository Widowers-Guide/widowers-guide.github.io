## Tree-Felled Tavern
Campaign: Reborn

### Description
A ragged tavern in the midst of a small town in the middle of nowhere. This tavern was the last remaining full structure of the town, the rest of the place having been raided by kobolds in the days prior to the drifters' arrival. The tavern has a bar area pressed against the left wall with a storage room, and two small subsections of tables, chairs, and a hearth. With the recent destruction of the area, the tavern had become a safehaven for the remaining citizens in the town. The few survivors of the town included an old gardener who fostered the plants around the building, who's fruit was medicinal but stems and leaves were poisonous.

### Drifters 
Upon first arriving at the city, the drifters began to split and check around for more information on the area. During this time, the Lantern Carrier acquired her signature lantern, and Baba Yaga learned a great deal about the poisonous fauna growing in the area. Several drifters also held conversation with a heroic dwarf visiting the town, riling up fighters to return with him and fight for the throne. The only one not actively exploring the town was Bojo, who was learning "ecomomics" from his new goblin friend, Schmee. Eventually, as the group came together, they heard the plight of the town and were asked to go slay the kobolds nearby.

However, an old man at the tavern recognized the drifters as reborn people, commenting not only on their appearance, but also hinting that he knew the location of the next well that they needed to visit. After sharing the well's location, the drifters were divided as to whether or not they should help the people or simply head to the next destination. Andrew's tiefling argued for leaving the town to fend for themselves, but the Lantern Carrier argued against, claiming that they ought to help the people with the hopes of not only helping others but also acquiring the old man's magic staff.

As the night grew late, the drifters retired to a nearby barn to sleep, save for Baba Yaga who slipped a grouping of poisonous plants into the tavern's ale supply. In the morning, Andrew's Tiefling formulated a scheme: take the staff from the old man to bribe the Lantern Carrier into convincing the group to leave. As the drifters returned to the tavern, they found most of the residents of the town horribly poisoned and lying on the floor. Andrew's tiefling took his opportunity, grabbing the staff from the ill man.

Unfortunately, Andrew's tiefling was wearing the Crown of Madness, which he had grabbed from the necromancer slain only days before. The Crown of Madness activated, sending the tiefling into a fighting frenzy and killing all the sick townspeople before turning his magic on the drifters. Half the drifters then became occupied with calming down the tiefling, while the other half simply walked outside, not wanting to deal with the situation.

The heroic dwarf in the corner excitedly jumped into the fray, causing the drifters to fight him as well. The tiefling destroyed the interior of the tavern with his destructive magics. Bojo, conflicted between which group he should be a part of, made a lucky guess at where he could find literature and found the "Book of Raising" hidden between the destroyed floorboards. Due to his low intelligence, however, he was unable to read the book and began refering to it as the "Book of Raisins". Meanwhile, on the outside, Skozz began leading a movement of attemping to chop down trees, trying to activate his new fire sword. While the sword never activated, he did manage to fell the tree... right on top of the tavern.

And so, the tavern was completely and utterly destroyed. Most of the townsfolk and the heroic dwarf were killed in the chaos. Regaining his sanity, Andrew's Tiefling ceased the fighting and threw the staff down to the Lantern Carrier, then led everyone out of the town on the way to the well. The group, having obtained the desired staff and having no villiage to save anymore, put up no protest.
