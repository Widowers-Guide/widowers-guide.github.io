## Capital City
Campaign: Drachend

### Geography
A large city on the southern coast of Drachend. The city is the largest on the continent, known for its bustling trade in the port with other nations. On all sides except that facing the ocean, large stone walls overlook the city. Within the walls are several layers of communities, including traders, farmers, merchants, nobles, etc.. At the heart of the Capital City is the castle which houses the royal family. Overall, the city is known for its melting pot of cultures and its significance to the continent of Drachend. 

Unfortunately, the Capital City was destroyed by a falling sun.

### Places of Interest
- The Abandoned Tavern: A small, dusty tavern inn that is located in the slums outside of the castle. This tavern is home to one of the secret enterances to the sewers. Cutting off the head of one of the bar's tap handles will reveal the passageway.

- The Sewer Path: An underground pathway leading to the castle. Full of monsters and difficult to navigate. A giant, magical white rat acts as a guide to any travelling to the castle via the sewers.

- The Capital's Castle: A large, looming rock structure on the northern side of town. The castle is home to the king and the princess, as well as several high-ranking knights, nobles, and hundreds of staff. The castle is also notable to having many secret passageways throughout its interior, and reaching out to the inner layer of the city.

### Drifters
Each group of the drifters had a different experience in the city, most relating to navigating the sewers to reach the interior of the castle. Tensions between nations were high when they first arrived, and each drifter group was from a different nation, attemping to either help/harm the city. 

One group of drifters kidnapped the princess, prompting the king to reach out to another band of drifters (who were natives to the city) to go hunt the kidnappers down. By the time both groups had left the city, however, the sun had fallen from the sky and destroyed not only the town but all the people therein. This prompted several drifters to question whether their quest should be pursued at all.
