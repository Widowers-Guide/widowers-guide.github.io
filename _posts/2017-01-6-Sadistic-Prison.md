## Sadistic Prison
Campaign: Ashen

### Description
A cold jail cell laying in the basement of Besna's citadel, lined with thick stone that prevents that dampens magic. There is a single rut cut into the floor where water flows through in a steady stream, providing muddy water for drinking and the occasional small fish for consumption. It is unclear whether this is the only cell of its kind in the citadel, but it appears to have been made with the intent of holding dangerous magic-users. The stone walls of the cell not only prevent the use of magic (much in a same way of General Tetsu, where they cause mental fatigue to magic-users attempting to cast spells to break focus), but in addition to that feature they also have proven strong against poisons, explosives, attacks, and nearly every other form of destruction.

### Drifters (Entry)
Shortly after their fight with Baumen, a bedraggled group of drifters were brought to Besna's citadel to speak with Lord Edith at last. Badly injured and demoralized, the group was led down to the basement and promptly locked up with Lord Edith in the sadistic prison, where they were held for six months on charges of treason for associating with Lord Edith. About four monthes into their imprisonment, Kingsley Oldbeard was also thrown into the jailcell, having recovered enough from his wounds to ask incessently about the fate of the drifters, only to be cast into the room as well. The drifters spent their time in the cell mostly suffering, but also chatting and starving to death. They were released after six months on a mistrial, allowing for a gold recompensation from King Tyban on behalf of his son's and Lady Venna's cruel deeds.

### Drifters (Infernal)
During their imprisonment, several members of the drifters spoke entirely in Infernal, most notable the Lantern Carrier and Skozz. They spent most of their time planning out their steps for dealing with the world once they were freed, but also reflecting on the other members of the drifters and how they believed the others would act in the future. This chat became infamous for Skozz starting the conversation but asking which one of the drifters the Lantern Carrier believed would be the best to eat first, once they all began starving. Later on in the chats, Baba Yaga made an appearance, scribbling thieves cant on the wall and making crude talk with the other infernal speakers. Chats later became scarce as Kingsley made his appearance in the prison, and as the Lantern Carrier began to forgoe her daily ration of food.

### Drifters (Destruction of the Ring)
As a favor to Skozz, the Lantern Carrier devised a plan to get Vaus to destroy the Ring of the Water Elemental. Knowing that Vaus was mostly only keeping the ring to spite Skozz, the Lantern Carrier spoke privately with Vaus, claiming she had sensative information to share with him, but that she would need a favor in return for sharing this secret. After much debate, Vaus finally agreed to the terms, and the Lantern Carrier showed the dragonborn the etchings that Baba Yaga had drawn on the wall, claiming to have interpretted Baba's incessent infernal mumbling to be a death threat against Vaus, planning on poisoning him as soon as they were released. Vaus then thanked the Lantern Carrier for the information, destroying the ring with his magic gorilla fist, and becoming wary of Baba Yaga. The Lantern Carrier then suggested Vaus keep close to Skozz to form an alliance against Baba Yaga, binding Vaus, The Lantern Carrier, and Skozz as an allied unit among the drifters.
