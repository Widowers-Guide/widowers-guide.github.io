## The Autumnal Leviathan

LOCATION: CAPTREE STATE PARK, NEW YORK

MINERAL: CARNELIAN

## Description

A large, curling sea serpent shimmering with all the colors of autumn laid into its fine scales. The Autumnal leviathan has webbed spines running all along its back in layered sets, much resembling the waves at sunset. It has a small set of horn-like protrusions on its head, and two whispy whiskers that float from its snout. Its chest is layered with v-shaped scales that appear to be made of bone. The Autumnal Leviathan, true to its name, appears only twice a year and always in the fall, showing itself to the lucky observer. It can shapeshift into the form of a red-haired child, often time with braided hair. Its scales click together as it moves, heating and boiling the water around it.

## Encounter
The Autumnal Leviathan is a surly, but sociable creature. It shows its face only during the fall months, but shows up at all the local celebrations and competitions during that time of year. Occassionally, a fisherman reports spotting the creature in its leviathan form, but personally I met the Autumnal Leviathan when it was disguised. A young, red-haired girl joined me for a picnic during the Fall Harvest Festival, and ate all of my seared scallops... I thought the girl was simply rude for not talking with me and yet helping herself to my dinner, but following the interaction, she promptly pulled out one of her loose teeth and leapt into the ocean. Dumbstruck, I peered over to see her swimming out to the distance, and in my hand a long curved wyrm tooth rather than a human's. I watched her swim off into the horizon, before deciding she was probably not in any danger of drowning.
