## The Broadsword Wyrm

LOCATION: RUNESTONE STATE PARK, OKLAHOMA

MINERAL: SODALITE

## Description

A feathered wyrm with shell-like plates and a tough head. Its teeth are large, somewhat flattened, and hidden beneath the shell that runs along the face. Feathers spurt from the sides and back of the head, curling inwards in many spots. It spots two pairs of large feathered wings with which it glides from spot to spot. The Broadsword Wyrm enjoys chewing on pieces of iron and other metals of a similar hardness. It can gnaw through a girder a day if left to its own devices, though it seldom gets a chance to find something of the size. It keeps a small collection of swords, poles, and other man-made metal rod objects that it chews on and destroys over time.

## Encounter
After stopping by the runestone festival, I had found that several of the sword fighters were fighting over a stolen ware. The secondary sword of one of the performers had gone missing, and fights had broken out over who had taken it (fights that went largely unnoticed, as the observers merely thought it was part of the act). Not two hundred feet away from the festivities, I found the wyrm anxiously chewing on the sword, perched in the treetop with its wings covering its face. By the time I reached the wyrm, the sword was broken in two, with long flat teeth marks all along where it had broken. Finished with its work, the wyrm attempted to sneak back into the swordfighter's quarters, only to be stymied by a rather intimidating standard fence.
