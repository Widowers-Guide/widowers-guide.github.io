## Chupacabrawl
Campaign: Ronin

### Kong Chupacabrawl Description
A four-armed gorilla demon with a heel personality formed when Nox prays to the gorilla god. It loves to fight, but is relaxed in nature and will play with its foes if it thinks they're too weak. Despite its bulk and heavy movements, it moves surprisingly fast and uses all four arms independently. Its face is a slate of warped bone, the right-side of which is pitted and scarred with a blunted horn. While it has no disernable eye, its vision is keen and it is capable of fighting multiple people at once. Iron studs are fused into the bones of its knuckles.

### Hel Chupacabrawl Description
A lithe skeletal demon with a manic personality formed when Felicia prays to Hel. It preys on fear, targetting the weakest enemies and pulling them <a href="https://drifter-handbook.github.io/inverted4">apart from their group</a>, letting them know they are doomed before striking the killing blow. Its hands are warped and tipped with long knife-like claws that it slips between the ribcages of its prey. Thanks to its strange body structure, it is capable not only of twisting its body to fit into small ducts, but also of moving silently through areas. It hates loud noises, and it not capable of speech besides different pitched clicks.

### Drifters
Chupacabrawl is the conjoined eldrich form of Felicia and Nox, unlocked shortly after their near-demise at the bank heist. The conjoined form shares the collective consciousnesses of both members but is highly aggressive and competitive.

Both Felicia and Nox share connections to old gods, and talked at length during their time at the Ronin safehouse about magic and cryptids in the modern era. The two paired well in combat and were often deployed together on missions: Felicia handling the more stealthy components of missions and Nox stepping in to fight when the team had to go loud.

Once Felicia was exposed to Black Lotus in close proximity to Nox, their thoughts became melded and manifested into a more physical thought, which they then learned could become tangible through intervention from one of the deities. Both began to see flickers of visions of these eldrich abominations within proximity to each other. Following their respective recoveries from the bank heist, the two began to investigate the matter, and realized that a prayer to their respective gods would enact a fusion into Chupacabrawl.
