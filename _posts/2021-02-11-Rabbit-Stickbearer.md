## The Rabbit Stickbearer

LOCATION: EMERALD BAY STATE PARK, CALIFORNIA

MINERAL: EMERALD

## Description
A lazy jackrabbit who bears a three-pronged stick, denoting her as a stick-bearer. She is much large and ambling than the typical rabbit, standing nearly four feet from feet to ear tips when upright. She has a long, winding tail that she utilizes when speaking to help gesture and convey meaning, as well as seconding as an extra appendage for all other sorts of potential applications. Always smells strongly of berries. Rumoured to be plotting all the time, but rarely actually causes trouble. A band of magpies serves her whims.


## Encounter
Finding the Rabbit Stickbearer isn't usually a problem if she's looking for you. In my case, she was. The Rabbit Stickbearer's magpies found me pretty quickly and escorted me out to the bay to meet with their illustrious leader, who was lounging in the only available shade. Despite her laid-back demeanor, she claimed to be quite the powerful creature. Rather than scare me off though, she merely waved me away and continued to bask in the lack of sun. I got the impression that, however tricky and conniving this creature may be, she also might just be lazy enough that it may cancel itself out. Even so, I don't think I imagined the glimmer of pickpocketed golden goods peaking out from underneath her beach chair...
