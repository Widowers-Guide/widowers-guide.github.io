## Silverbeaks

LOCATION: BORDER FIELD STATE PARK, CALIFORNIA

MINERAL: SILVER

## Description
A species of profoundly-small silver pelican, the size of a figurine. Silverbeaks can fit within the palm of your hand, and appears as though they were a cast-silver toy or sculpture. Despite this, they have beautifully ornate detailing, with fluffy feathers, as well as very fluid and dynamic movements. Silverbeaks are tough to spot on account for their sizes, but can often be found posing as a discarded figure among the pebbles. When taken home, they will continue to remain inanimate until nightfall, at which time they will fly away and leave a small silver egg behind for the captor. This egg will hatch when the owner least expects it, and bring fortune until that day.


## Encounter
I knew of Silverbeak eggs long before I ever saw or even heard of the creature itself. They're sold under many different names, and I already had a bracelet made up of them. I was convinced that they would never hatch when, out while scouting out Belmont, my necklace suddenly broke and a small silver bird emerged. It seemed capable enough of caring for itself, but I decided to care for and accompany the creature back to California, where I was instructed to set it loose. While I cannot attest to the properties of luck which the Silverbeaks' eggs perscribe, I can say that my journey out to California was one of the most delightful ones I've had the pleasure to make, and that I loved that bird dearly.
