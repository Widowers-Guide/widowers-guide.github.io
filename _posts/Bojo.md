## Bojo

### 2/9

Campaign: Ashen

### Personality
A baffling character all around. Bojo speaks in illiterate third person in common, giving off a likely accurate impression of not being the most intelligent being but kind in heart. Bojo sees the world split into groups of friends and not-friends and his actions are dictated by who is in what group, though those actions can be completely bizarre to those that are not Bojo. He may chop off a horse's head, a known threat and hunt to Bojo, and throw it at a friend as a thoughtful gift, and give an enemy free clothing because Bojo thinks the pants are scratchy and wanted to give the person pain. Most people find it easier to smile and nod at Bojo's antics and continue onward as he is mostly harmless.

### Description

Bojo takes the form of a disturbingly attractive male drow with flowing white hair. He wears black tight leather accentuating his glistening muscles and curves, further adding to the confusion when his personality is anything but seductive. Over his shoulders he wears his rusted bagpipes and a sack used as a carrier for his trusted pet companion goblin Schmee. While he was a brute barbarian fighting before thinking when he was in his reborn form, as a drow Bojo has been forced to recognize his own weakness and opts to assist his party members and yell numerous explitives at enemies before fleeing when enemies get too close. On the common occasion where Bojo is tricked into drinking alcohol, he either becomes completely incapacitated or seems to lose his fear of battle and fights close combat with the courage he once had. His often accidental choices on the battlefield act as an element of surprise for both enemies and allies alike, which are what likely assisted Bojo in surviving as long as he has.
