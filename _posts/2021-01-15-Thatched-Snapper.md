## The Thatched Snapper

LOCATION: TURTLE RIVER STATE PARK, NORTH DAKOTA

MINERAL: ALEXANDRITE

## Description

A large snapping turtle with uneven black plates along its shell and ribs. Its neck is elongated and covered with bone-like scales, as are its feet. Along the back of its shell, large glossy eyes are embedded like gemstones into the nestled divits of each plate. Each eye is a wet purple with a reptilian slit, and wander independent of each other. The Thatched Snapper only emerges at night to feed on the murky plants which grown at hte bottom of the river. It doesn't like to leave the water, and does not enjoy company. Suspected to cheat at cards.

## Encounter

Upon my first visit to Turtle River, I stayed nearly three weeks without ever spotting the fellow. When I did finally catch up to him, he looked at me with disgust, made a sort of honking noise, and turned back into the water. I stuck around another few days for another peek. This time, as I tried to approach, he snapped at me, all of his extra eyes glowing a luminous white as his temper picked up. I later found out from my mentor that the Thatched Snapper, while unnamed, was a vocal creature who would entertain company, but only specific company. Now I can visit the Thatched Snapper whenever I please, as the secret is simply to bring along a set of dice or other gambling game of choice that can be played by a snapping turtle. I believe he's a horrible cheat, but he still refuses to converse with me, and dissapears after taking all my cash. I dare not dwell on what he does with my money, I can't imagine it being terribly useful to one such as himself.
