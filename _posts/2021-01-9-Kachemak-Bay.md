## Vagabond

LOCATION: KACHEMAK BAY, ALASKA

MINERAL: FLUORITE (GREEN)

## Description

A massive black bear with the markings of a gryfalcon. Its wings appear to be unusable, and are completely black save for small white stars of color near the tips. Wing-like tufts of feathers sprout from its head, and each paw has two long talons. He wanders from place to place by foot, but can aide in the travel of others. Can turn a major travel into a minor one. He prefers to hunt along the coast in the tide zones.

## Encounter

Met Vagabond on his own terms, teleported me up north after encountering the Tennick Serpent in Alabama. Vagabond was the first vocal creature I'd met in my life. I was ill-suited to Alaska's climate, seeing that it was January, but Vagabond lent me a spare set of his furs after seeing me being rather uncomfortable.
