## The Creeping Ladder

LOCATION: CROSS RANCH STATE PARK, NORTH DAKOTA

MINERAL: MOSS AGATE

## Description

A seemingly innoculous ladder sitting wedged between the roots of a boxelder tree. Upon first glance, it appears to be just the top foot of a ladder, sticking plainly out of the dirt. When touched, however, it rends the earth in two, creating a chasm that extends down several hundred feet. The ladder can be touched, but the act of trying to climb it proves impossible. It can shapeshift and change what type of material it is made out of, turning to sap or water beneath your grasp. Letting go of the ladder causes the chasm to close back up instantly, hiding whatever was hidden down there in the first place.

## Encounter

I was determined to get to the bottom of the chasm caused by the Creeping Ladder, so I sought one out immediately upon arriving in North Dakota. I didn't think it was a creature of any sort, just perhaps some artifact left behind by a creature. It became very clear to me, though, upon trying to climb the ladder, that it is indeed a faerie of its own state and mind, and a rather sadistic on at that. It'll buck and jump to try to fling you off once you get a ways down it, or sometimes the rungs will simply fall to sand beneath your grasp. Unwilling to give up knowledge of what is at the bottom, I hurled myself from the ladder, hoping to hit the bottom of the pit in one piece. Instead, I found myself falling upwards, and landing back on solid ground in the middle of the forest. Many times I tried to climb the ladder, and many times I failed. The fun was in the discovery, but I'll be quite bruised for quite some time...
