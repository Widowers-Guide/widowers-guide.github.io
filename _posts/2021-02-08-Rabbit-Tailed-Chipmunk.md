## The Rabbit-Tailed Chipmunk

LOCATION: BATTLE MOUNTAIN FOREST STATE PARK, OREGON

MINERAL: Emerald

## Description

A spry, Least Chipmunk with a distinctive Cottontail Rabbit tail and a set of talons on its back feet. The Rabbit-Tailed Chipmunk enjoys feasting on wicker baskets left out by unsuspecting picnic-goers, and enjoys skittering its way through unattended cars to plunder whatever its heart so desires.

Its spunky spirit more than makes up for these shortcomings, however, and it is always excited to get into whatever mischief it can manage.
