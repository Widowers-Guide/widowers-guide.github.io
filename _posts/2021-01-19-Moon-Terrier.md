## The Moon Terrier

LOCATION: SMITH FALLS STATE PARK, NEBRASKA

MINERAL: CITRINE QUARTZ

## Description

A small Irish Terrier with a tawny pelt, constantly surrounded by its own small swarm of stars. This dog makes no sound as it runs, but the small cluster of stars swing around its head constantly, clumsily bumping into each other and making soft clinking sounds when they do so. The stars appear less like actual stars, and more like glass bulbs suspended by invisible wires above its head. It runs through the land late at night, bringing its cloud of light with it as it sprints by the riverbanks. Its bark summons up a small swarm of glowing grasshoppers to lead travellers back to their beds back home.

## Encounter
Unfortunately, I struggle navigating a few of these parks when I start hunting for creatures late at night. A midsummer night while I was keeping my eye out for the Moon Terrier, I accidentally slipped into a mud patch and fell down a small craggy cliff in the dark. If it had happened earlier in the day, it wouldn't have been an issue, but the night was well on its way and I was exhausted from my efforts already. Injured and despairing, I was rudely jostled from my stupor by a rough tongue licking my cheek. When I opened my eyes, the land was bathed in a fine silver light, and the Moon Terrier was yapping happily at me. It ran off as I got back to my feet, but its grasshoppers stuck around to show me the way back to my tent. Tired though I was, I kept my eye on the grasshopper who sat outside my tent, gently ushering him into my living quarters so that I could keep an eye on him (after offering him some slices of cucumber). In the morning, the grasshopper remained, but lost its unique coloring and luminosity, becoming a regular grasshopper once more.
