## Ronin Safehouse
Campaign: Reborn

### Description
A moderately-sized suite in Eastern Tokyo, furnished with cheap sofas and a makeshift office. The area is mostly used for storage, but some members of the clan such as Nox, Felicia, and Overwatch, use the place 24/7. The leftmost room has no windows, and serves as Overwatch's computer rig room, furnished with a single beat-up sofa for debriefing the team. The central area has a small kitchen that has not been cleaned in a long time. Various potted plants are scattered throughout the facility, though no one is quite sure who is bringing them in. Most of the technology in the suite has long been outdated. Despite being messy and poor condition in general, the suite is large with many empty rooms, completely soundproofed, and overall secure.

### Drifters 
While part of the Ronin clan, the safehouse was the drifters' home away from home. It generally serves as their headquarters for the family's missions, however there is another larger and nicer safehouse nearby belonging to the Patriarch Lucielle Johnson which has also been used by the Ronin clan.
