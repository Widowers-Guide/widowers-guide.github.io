##The Wren Stickbearer

LOCATION: CATTAIL COVER STATE PARK, ARIZONA

MINERAL: PYRITE

## Description

A cactus wren with an interesting crest of feathers running along her head. Her feet appear to be made of wood, like sticks that were joined together at various angles to make legs. Above her head, back, and feet hover small droplets of water. It carries around a three-pronged stick, tapping the sides of cacti as it flitters about. She possesses the ability to speak any language and fulfill most desires of those who find her. Only the most desperate stumble into the Wren Stickbearer, and she does what she can to help.

## Encounter
I will keep my encounter notes for the Wren Stickbearer brief, as it was a very personal challenge I was facing when I was visited by this lovely bird. We spent the evening chatting, and she offered to help me with my dillema, though I did not realize I had any dillema at the time. She seemed short of breath during the entire conversation, as though she had been travelling from place to place without rest. I learned little about her, as I had other things on my mind and it felt rude to pry. Overall though, she gave the impresseion that she was a capable but busy young bird, and that helping others was somewhat of a passion for her. I can't say I understand how she helped in the way she did, but I've no desire to dissect the powers at work in this regard.
