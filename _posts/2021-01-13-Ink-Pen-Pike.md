## Pen Nib Pike

LOCATION: KEYHOLE STATE PARK, WYOMING

MINERAL: TIGER'S EYE

## Description

A long, slender type of fish with the head resembling a calligraphy pen nib. Their bodies are a sleek, metallic grey, and do not shine in the sun. Instead of scales, the Pen Nib Pike has divits in its body, much like a cheese grater. This fish does not swim, but instead stays perfectly still in the water, completely defying the physics of the fluid around it to stay stationary among turbulent water and still water alike. The other fish feed the Pen Nib Pike, though they don't seem to benefit from it in any regard. This fish knows when you are nearby. A sighting of one of these fish will result in the watcher gaining sudden inspiration, but only if they were not hunting for the fish in the first place.

## Encounter

As one with ichthyophobia, I was not looking forward to finding this particular creature. But, it worked to my benefit, for as soon as I did lay eyes on it, I had a brilliant idea for a novel! It was a great defense mechanism on the faerie's behalf, since I soon forgot to record observational notes on the creature such as its location or behaviour. I had to record most things off my poor memory. I remember it being quite eerie, but I'm very excited with what I've found. Perhaps fish feel the same way after feeding this strange creature. I wonder what inspires a fish?
