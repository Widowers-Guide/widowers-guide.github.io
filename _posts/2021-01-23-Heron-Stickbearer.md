## The Heron Stickbearer

LOCATION: POTATO CREEK STATE PARK, INDIANA

MINERAL: SAPPHIRE

## Description

A Great Blue Heron with large bushy brows, carrying a three-pronged stick with its beak. The Heron Stickbearer looks over the wetlands of Potato Creek, managing gossip between all the birds and sharing it with all the fish of the area. It seems to enjoy gleaning information off of humans too, often listening in on conversations and sharing its findings with the rest of the wildlife. It has a cackling laugh, and occasionally has four wings.

## Encounter
The Heron Stickbearer knew of my arrival long before I planned a trip out to Potato Creek, and when pressed to explain how that was, he didn't seem inclined to share his sources. He was a jovial sort, and perhaps a bit concieted, often acting as though he was a bit surperior to myself. Even as he showed me around the area, he seemed to delight in all the small interactions the other creatures paid to him, as though showing off how nature respected him far more than it would ever respect me. While he was generous with his knowledge to the other creatures of the wetlands, he did not deign to share any of his plentiful knowledge with humans, including myself. I would be interested in knowing what it would take to pry that knowledge from his beak, but I'd imagine you'd need to spend quite some time with the heron before he'd even consider such a thing.
