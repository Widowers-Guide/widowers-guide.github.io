## Harriman Bluebirds

LOCATION: HARRIMAN STATE PARK, IDAHO

MINERAL: HAÜYNE

## Description

Almost indistinct from a mountain bluebird when they're at rest, save for a slightly more almond-shaped head. They are, however, flightless, and reveal long crane legs when they decide to get up and move about. Their coloring changes at night time, when their blue plummage turns completely clear, along with the rest of their body. At that point, they resemble glass. They seem to prefer roosting on the ground and amongst the trees equally.

## Encounter

I'm not sure how many I managed to encounter during my visit, as I suspect to have missed several. Spotting them during the morning hours is possible, but it's tough to tell them apart from regular mountain bluebirds unless they get up and move on their own accord. Startling them seems to allow them to fly a short distance with their legs still tucked, maintaining their false appearance. Spotting them at night is even tougher, due to their invisible appearance, but I was able to catch sight of a few milling about in the early hours of morning.
