## The Hollow Wyrm

LOCATION: BATTLE MOUNTAIN FOREST STATE PARK, OREGON

MINERAL: SAPPHIRE

## Description
A dragon with a long, crocodile-like snout, a layered tortoise's shell, and a long wrapping tail embedded with numerous auxillery flippers. The Hollow Wyrm appears almost skeletal in appearance, with sunken eyes and bony protrusions, but its true eyes can be seen beneath its false coloring, and the flesh on its bones is simply oriented to try to pass off this illusion. Under artificial light, the flesh of the Hollow Wyrm turns transparent, so that the only thing distinguishing it from that of its fossil kin is the slight movement of its ribs as it breathes. The Hollow Wyrm is a spectral beast who can invade the minds of those who gaze upon it, and it appears in the viewer's dreams for several nights. It was once viewed as a symbol of great but fleeting luck.


## Encounter
While perhaps not dangerous, I'd still advise caution when dealing with the Hollow Wyrm. It is, at its root, a quite vengeful creature, and all my conversations with it has been as such. I first encountered the Hollow Wyrm on an archeological trip out in Nevada, and found myself face-to-face with a rather interesting set of Ichthyosaur fossils displayed in one of this park's display houses. That night, I began to have dreams involving the Hollow Wyrm, vague and undetailed, but marking it as a vocal creature nonetheless. While I could ask little and remember next to nothing, I did learn that the Wyrm was a longtime resident of the area, and had abandoned its previous name out of spite. It recalled for me a time at which it was a well-known symbol of luck, and now was rumored to cause misfortune. It didn't care much for those rumors, and insisted I did not spread them. About five days after laying eyes on the bones, the visions ceased. I later returned to the park several years later to find the skeleton missing. I am not certain whether it was removed due to incident, donated to another museum, or perhaps if it simply waltzed out itself on other business.
