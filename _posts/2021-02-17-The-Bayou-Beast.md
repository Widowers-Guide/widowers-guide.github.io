## The Bayou Beast

LOCATION: BAYOU SEGNETTE STATE PARK, LOUISIANA

MINERAL: RUBY

## Description

A hefty brown crocodile with feather-like square scales protruding from its body. THe Bayou Beast is well over twelve feet long, with a mouth full of old, yellowed teeth, and a goat's eye rather than a crocodile's on the left side of its head. It resembles a wyrm in reference to its proportions, with a long, meaty snout and a bulky torso, but the rest of the crocodile's body is equally beefy and tough. Despite its dangerous appearance, the Bayou Beast is a quiet and content creature, preferring to bask in the sun's rays with its mouth open, taking in the heat of the day, and lazily ignoring the need to hunt.

## Encounter
I confused several large alligators with the Bayou Beast on my visit out to the park, as I was not quite sure what I was looking for, and any reptile longer than 5 feet held my interest as being a potentially magical creature. The Bayou Beast was, however, a sight in and of itself that is not easily mistaken with any other sort of creature. For starters, it is a murky mud brown, the kind of color you find in a sunlit swamp when you gaze down deep into the water. Its size is enough to tip you off that this isn't any ordinary beast, and then it's got that striking golden goat eye that peers up at you from the shore or just beneath the warm waters. If you encounter the Bayou Beast while it's lounging on land, it appears fat and lazy and content to simply sit and enjoy the day. If you encounter the Bayou Beast in the water, like I did, however, you may want to think twice before jumping in. Locals say that it doesn't bite, but it'll sometimes brush past your legs or give you a nudge in the water to let you know that it's nearby, and that it's hunting.
