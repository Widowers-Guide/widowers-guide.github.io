## The Tennick Serpent

LOCATION: BLUE SPRINGS STATE PARK, ALABAMA

MINERAL: ARGONITE

## Description

A long grey serpent, approximately three feet in length from what I could see of it. Its head is more aquiline than a regular snake's. Does not stay near the heart of the spring, where the man-made structures have been constructed, but instead prefers further downsteam in the Choctawhatchee River. Long fronds of grey weeds and grey stones are inlaid onto the upper portion of its body. It has no scales, only a smooth body.

## Encounter

Seemed friendly, or at the very least, curious. Spotted around dusk in January. It was very visible in the banks of the spring, not hiding from view. Left a small trail of shadows behind it as it slithered further downstream.
