## Cheeseman

LOCATION: SPRING MOUNTAIN RANCH STATE PARK, NEVADA

MINERAL: RUBY

## Description
A small, incongruent bat with a tendency to cause trouble to the humans who live in the area. Cheeseman resembles a small Pallid Bat with a human-like face. He always wears a dented bottle-capt as a necklace, secured by a piece of twine. Cheeseman is a skilled aeriel dancer, and enjoys dazzling crowds with his twirling displays. He's also quite the show-off, frequently trying to steal the show away from other potential performers. Cheeseman's love for humanity is rarely reciprocated, as his behaviour tends to be rather annoying or simply misplaced. Regardless, he has a few good human friends, with whom he enjoys sharing stories and acting out his own original works in private showcases.


## Encounter
While I enjoy my role as a researcher, err... logger? I do take a break every now and then. More often than not, however, I still run into someone strange along the trail. In this case, I was sitting down to a nice showing at the local theatre when Cheeseman swooped in alongside me, taking up the seat next to me. I thought it funny until he opened his mouth, trying to guage my reaction to the current performance. When I refused to break my respectful silence, he then got up on stage and began swooping about, trying to demonstrate a different type of casting placement that he'd discussed with me prior. It was quite the strange thing to deal with, from the audience and actors both. Afterwards, a few friends of the bat handed out vouchers for free ice cream at a local establishment. They apologized for their friends behaviour, promising that it had happened quite a bit in the past, and would likely continue into the future, but that they would give him a stern talking to anyways.
