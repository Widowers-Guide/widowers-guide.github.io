## Swordfrog
Campaign: Ashen

### Personality

Swordfrog is a man with the personality of a frog. Despite his best efforts to acclimate to society again, he is a frog at heart. He is kind, lighthearted, and an upstanding citizen, seeking to protect his friends above all else. Swordfrog is also highly vengeful, however, seeking lifelong revenge on a diety who cost him his froggy form. In most cases, though, Swordfrog is simply a happy man with a chipper attitude and a love for wordplay.

### Description

Appearing as one of the few humans in the Ashen saga, Swordfrog is only human as far as his appearance goes. His behaviours, mannerisms, and armor are all linked to his past as a frog, a life that he longs for. He is a fighter by trade, hoping to play defensive roles on the battlefield and disrupt enemy attacks. His favored tactics are rushing at enemies to seperate them from group and scaring enemies (or at least attempting to). Swordfrog is also notably tenacious, able to find a second-wind in the heat of battle and bolster his attacks and defensive manuevers.

### Story

Swordfrog is the frog from the story the Princess and the Frog. A prince from a faraway kingdom, he was tragically turned into a frog at a young age under a magical curse. Lucielle Johnson reversed his curse later, turning him back into a human, but Swordfrog longed for his frog form back and ended up with a lifelong vendetta against Lucielle Johnson. He has sworn the rest of his life to either killing Lucielle Johnson or forcing him to revert Swordfrog back into his amphibious state. 

### Drifters

Swordfrog is the reincarnated Thornfrog, a cactus who was tragically killed in the Age of Heroes arc.

During the Ashen arc, Swordfrog's one mission is to kill Lucielle Johnson. When talking with Lucielle Johnson after killing the Chimera, Swordfrog finally gets his chance as Lucielle invites Swordfrog to attempt to kill him. Swordfrog initially declines this, thinking it a trick, but attempts to stab the immortal later. His efforts, however, fail.

Swordfrog attempted to be a shielding character in battle, trying to save other drifters in difficult battles, but typically failed at this and became more of an attacking figure in battles. His most notable fight is within the Temple of the Observer, where Swordfrog attempted to 1v1 a living wall. Upon passing a check and failing to be frightened from the whispers from the wall, Swordfrog yelled "You think YOU can scare ME? Well I'M going to scare YOU". His scare attempt failed and he was killed shortly after. Throughout the remainder of the fight, Swordfrog was killed by the same enemy several times, and shot once by Lilith for making a bad pun.

### Relationships

- Lucielle Johnson: Swordfrog has a lifelong vendetta against this immortal, and seeks to force him into letting him be a frog again.
- Lilith: The two seem to get along well, although Lilith has shot Swordfrog in the middle of battle.
