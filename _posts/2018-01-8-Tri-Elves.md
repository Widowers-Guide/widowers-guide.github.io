## Triumvirate Elves
Campaign: Reborn

### Description
A unique variety of elves found on the three islands of Tael, Lun, and Vi. In contrast to the elves common to most lands, these elves were a bit taller in appearance and their skin was cracked, revealing pits of dark energy which lifted off of their flesh once the skin was broken. All the elves in these communities wore white animal masks which they seemed to never remove. Their magic was contained to crystals, and their society was split, on the verge of war between factions.

### Drifters
The leaders of the elves summoned the drifters to perform a set of assassinations for them, then threatened the drifters into going through with the missions or risk being killed for trying to leave. The elves showed no interest in helping the refugees outside the city of Zerahul, despite several drifters attempting to negotiate for their help. Despite their attempts to be subtle about the assassination, trying to blackmail the drifters went about as smoothly as you'd think, and the drifters made it to their destination safetly while the elves began an internal war among their factions.
